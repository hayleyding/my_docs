1. In the onboarding document's **Section 1**, the final prerequisite is to review the **managed services onboarding document** [https://github.com/Versent/vms-docs/blob/master/managed-services/on-boarding.md](https://github.com/Versent/vms-docs/blob/master/managed-services/on-boarding.md). This document includes instructions for raising tickets on 1Password and PagerDuty. However, in **Sections 2.4 and 2.5**, there are additional, more specific instructions for using these services. It's important to note that before raising internal support tickets for these services, employees must first obtain approval from their principal. To streamline the process, it's recommended that employees combine these requests and ask for principal approval at one time.
2. **Section 3.2**

    tickets

    SR05 Contractor ELMO On-Boarding & 

    SR57 Freshservice Access &

    SR40 New Starter-New Azure AD account  

    could be requested first, because I don’t have the freshservice agent access right now, I can’t see all the tickets raised for me. I may have re-submitted some tickets. 

3. maybe move **section 3.4.5 and 3.4.8 to 3.3.1**? Because they are also some tickets to be raised on FreshService.
4. **Section 3.8 confirm access and review** could  be more clear
    
    for example: I currently see Snowflake in my apps dashboard, but I do not have access to it. Additionally, I cannot confirm whether I have access to Snowflake proxy because I lack access to Snowflake itself.
    
    
    Also, this section may can be combined with this page. [https://github.com/Versent/vms-docs/blob/master/managed-services/on-boarding/versent-onboarding-verification.md](https://github.com/Versent/vms-docs/blob/master/managed-services/on-boarding/versent-onboarding-verification.md)

    **section AWS Accounts - Versent Innovation**
    
    can’t edit role myself, need to raise an internal support ticket
    
6. some stack channels don’t exist anymore (**section 2.1**)
    
    for example: 
    
    - #test_env_deployments
    - #release_env_deployments
    - #dev_env_deployments
7. **section 3.6.3** step3, the details on 1password are incorrect
